							<h1>Professional experience</h1>
							<p>I have extensive experience as a GIS specialist, working on a variety of projects and clients over the course of my career. Throughout my various roles, I have demonstrated my ability to use spatial data to solve complex problems and provide valuable insights to stakeholders.

								In my previous positions, I was responsible for developing and implementing GIS solutions for clients across a range of industries. This included analyzing spatial data to identify trends and patterns, and presenting my findings in a clear and concise manner. I also created and managed geospatial databases, ensuring that the data was accurate, up-to-date, and well-organized.
								
								In addition to my technical expertise, I have also conducted fieldwork to collect and verify spatial data, using GPS and other tools to map physical features and assets. I have also designed and delivered GIS training programs for clients and colleagues, helping to improve their understanding of GIS and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.
								
								Overall, I am proud of the impact that I have had as a GIS specialist, and look forward to continuing to use my skills and expertise to drive positive change in the field.</p>
