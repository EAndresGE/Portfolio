						<h1>Rantalaidun project</h1>
					
						<p> As an trainee at LUKE, I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project requiring the use of GIS tools. The project aimed to digitize secure pasture areas, determine the best water sample collecting areas based on specific criteria, generate maps to inform and present to outside companies working with the project, and manage large geodatabases that collected the data relevant to the project.

							The project was significant as it focused on ensuring the sustainability of pastureland in the area. Our team used cutting-edge GIS technology to map out the pasture areas and identify potential risks to the environment. My role in the project was vital as I had the responsibility of digitizing the pasture areas and managing the geodatabases that collected the data.</p>

									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/r2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>One of my most significant contributions to the project was using my expertise in GIS technology to identify the best water sample collecting areas based on specific criteria. The results of my analysis helped our team to pinpoint the areas of the pastureland where water quality was most at risk. We used this information to develop strategies to mitigate any potential risks to the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, my time at Rantalaidun was an incredible experience. I was able to work on a project that had a real impact on the environment, and my contributions were instrumental in achieving the project's objectives. I gained invaluable experience working with GIS technology and managing large geodatabases. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a talented team and look forward to using the skills I gained at Rantalaidun in my future career</strong></p>
