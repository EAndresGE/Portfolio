							<h1>Finding a site for a new biathlon high school</h1>
							
					<p>During this academic project, I worked as a GIS specialist for a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The goal was to help local policymakers in the Joensuu area find the optimal site for a new biathlon-oriented high school. This involved considering a set of criteria such as maximizing the distance to the nearest high schools, minimizing the distance to training facilities, maximizing the number of population aged 0 to 14 within a 3 km radius, and ensuring the school is located in population centers and at least 100 m away from inland waters due to land use regulations.</p>
					<p>To solve this problem, I needed to use several GIS tools, including ArcGIS Pro. One of the essential tools for this project was the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which helped me to prepare and execute a multi-criteria analysis with spatial data. The MCDA allowed me to define and rank the criteria that policymakers provided and assign weights to them based on their relative importance.

						Another crucial tool was the Cost Surface and Cost Distance, which I used to compute the least-cost path between two locations. This tool allowed me to model how the different costs (e.g., distance to high schools, population density) influenced the final decision.</p>

					<p>However, the most useful tool for me was Model Builder. It is an excellent tool for creating complex workflows and better keeping track of intermediate data. With Model Builder, I was able to build a step-by-step process that clearly shows the input, output, and processing of the different tools used in the analysis.

						Using Model Builder, I created a customized tool that allowed policymakers to input different criteria and weights to obtain a decision surface. This surface showed the best locations for the high school based on the input criteria. This tool also had the flexibility to adjust the criteria and weights, allowing policymakers to explore different options and see how changes affected the final decision.</p>
		
					<p><strong>The use of GIS tools such as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, Cost Surface and Cost Distance, and Model Builder proved to be very useful in solving the multi-criteria decision-making problem for the high school site selection. The Model Builder tool, in particular, allowed me to build a customized workflow and a tool that met the needs of the policymakers. Through this project, I developed a better understanding of spatial analysis, learned new techniques, and gained valuable experience in using ArcGIS Pro.</strong></p>
