							<h1>Spatial and Statistical Analysis using ArcGIS, R, and Public Participation GIS</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/professional1.png" alt="" /></span>As a spatial analyst, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of professional projects that have helped me hone my technical and conceptual skills. One such project involved using ArcGIS desktop for spatial data analysis and R for statistical analysis to determine the conflict between social use areas and flying squirrel habitats.

								The project was challenging, as it required a series of spatial data analysis tools to obtain the spatial relationship between the conflicting factors in three different municipalities. Spatial interpolation methods such as Getis-Ord and Kernel density were used, and the results were compared across multiple scales. The project also involved statistical methods such as phi coefficient and Bhattacharyya distance to verify the results.
								
								What made this project particularly unique was the use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) for data gathering. PPGIS involves engaging stakeholders in the data gathering process, providing valuable insights into the complex problems that arise when managing natural resources. In this case, the engagement of stakeholders helped provide critical data about the use of social areas, which were then analyzed using spatial tools to determine the spatial relationship between social areas and flying squirrel habitats.</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/preofessional2.png" alt="" /></span>Working on this project provided me with an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities of ArcGIS desktop and R software, and their ability to handle large datasets with ease. It also gave me the opportunity to work with PPGIS, an important approach that recognizes the importance of community engagement in decision-making processes.

								The project has also provided me with a better understanding of spatial analysis tools and their ability to provide insights into complex problems. The skills and knowledge gained from this project have been invaluable and will enable me to effectively tackle complex spatial problems in future projects.
								
								Overall, working on this project has not only helped me improve my technical and conceptual skills but has also given me a better appreciation for the important role that community engagement plays in spatial data analysis. As a spatial analyst, I recognize the importance of working closely with stakeholders to gather critical data that can inform decision-making processes.</p>
